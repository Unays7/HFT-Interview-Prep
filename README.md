# HFT-Interview-Prep
Guide to prepare for HFT interviews (SWEs)

## Operating Systems/Low-level Knowledge:

  Reading:
  1. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces - https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/
  2. Algorithmica / HPC - https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/
  3. What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory - https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf
  
  Watching:
  1. CppCon 2017: Carl Cook “When a Microsecond Is an Eternity: High Performance Trading Systems in C++” - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM (Goated)
  2. Trading at light speed: designing low latency systems in C++ - David Gross - Meeting C++ 2022 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uAW5FQtcvE (Good watch)
  
  Activities:
  1. https://highload.fun/ (mess around with this to learn optimisation techniques)
  
 
## Networking:

  Adding soon


## DSA/Algo Interview Prep:

  Reading:
  1. Competitive Programmer’s Handbook - https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf (short & sweet)
  2. Introduction to Algorithms - N/A (long, but whatever knowledge you need to consolidate from CP handbook read on specifc chapters & answer qs)
  
  Doing:
  1. Neetcode.io -  https://neetcode.io/practice (Do the neetcode 150)
  2. Leetcode - https://leetcode.com/ (obvious but needed, do contests on weekends to build up the skill to solve qs under time pressue)
  3. CSES Problem set - https://cses.fi/problemset/list (Harder than LC but will make you better)
  
  
## System Design:
 
  Reading: 
  1. System Design Interview By Alex Lu - (Good, will help bit long tho)
  
  Watching
  1. Grokking Modern System Design Interview - Educative.io (Can finish it quite quick, pair that with practicing random cases with a friend)
  
  
## Mix of All/Other Resouces:

  Reading: 
  1. Developing High-Frequency Trading Systems: Learn how to Implement High-frequency Trading from Scratch with C++ Or Java Basics (10/10 imo, really good and touches on relevant topics i.e operating systems/concurrency, networkig, domain knowledge)
  2. Will list other good books soon

  Doing:
  1. BUILD BUILD BUILD, no better way to learn than to build you own projects focused on HFT i.e. Order Book implementaion.
